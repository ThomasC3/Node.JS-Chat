This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

   Launch the app from the Terminal:
   
    $ node server.js

As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.

Enjoy!
