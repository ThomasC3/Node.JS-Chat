Welcome to my Node.js chat client!

This chat example showcases how to use `socket.io` with a static `express` server.

## Running the server

1) Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

    $ node server.js

2.) Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/'. 

As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the message is shared with all connected clients.

Enjoy!
